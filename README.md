# Exploring-LEGO-Rebrickable-Data---Python
Analyzed the LEGO Rebrickable dataset using Python and the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. A number of pandas functions were used to gain insights, including merge() and groupby() and Tableau was used to visualize the results.

The objective of this project is to conduct an analysis of the Rebrickable LEGO Dataset using the data manipulation and exploration capabilities of the Pandas library. Through the examination of real-world scenarios, the project aims to demonstrate the utilization of various Pandas functions, such as MERGE, GROUPBY, and others, in addressing complex data analysis questions. Specifically, the project will focus on the following skills: the utilization of the MERGE function to join DataFrames, the creation of derived columns based on existing data, and an understanding of various methods for exploring data with Pandas.
